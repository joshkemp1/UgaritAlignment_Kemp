# Alignment Guidelines
## Written by Joshua Kemp and adapted from the guidelines of Dr. Chiara Palladino and Farnoosh Shamsian
### Punctuation
Punctuation is never aligned, for two reasons:
  1. There was no punctuation in the original edition of the Greek text.
  2. Aligning punctuation improperly skews the proportion of 1-1 alignments to other alignment types (1-N, N-1, N-N) and the percentage of total text aligned.
### Untranslated/poorly translated words
If words appear only in either the source language (GRK) or the translation (ENG) OR are not lexically consistent, they are not aligned.
### Idiomatic Phrases
If a group of words in one language possesses a semantic equivalent in the other, the phrases are aligned with an N-N link (i.e., dative of possession).
### Repetition
Due to the capabilities of the Ugarit alignment software, the first instance of a word that is repeated in one language (typically in ENG) is aligned to the single instance in the other language. Repetition is typically a dramatic flair in translation and therefore irrelevanet to the alignment.
### Negation
Align negation 1-1, (i.e., uses of οὐ, μὴ) unless:
  1. The negative English morpheme is abbreviated (-n't) and cannot be separated from the word group.
  2. The structure of a verbal phrase is changed in English.
