# Alignment Guidelines
## Written by Joshua Kemp and adapted from the guidelines of Dr. Chiara Palladino and Farnoosh Shamsian
### Punctuation
Punctuation is never aligned, for two reasons:
  1. There was no punctuation in the original edition of the Greek text.
  2. Aligning punctuation improperly skews the proportion of 1-1 alignments to other alignment types (1-N, N-1, N-N) and the percentage of total text aligned.
