### Punctuation
Punctuation is never aligned, for two reasons:
  1. There was no punctuation in the original edition of the Greek text.
  2. Aligning punctuation improperly skews the proportion of 1-1 alignments to other alignment types (1-N, N-1, N-N) and the percentage of total text aligned.

### Untranslated/poorly translated words
If words appear only in either the source language (GRK) or the translation (ENG) OR are not lexically consistent, they are not aligned.

### Idiomatic Phrases
If a group of words in one language possesses a semantic equivalent in the other, the phrases are aligned with an N-N link (i.e., dative of possession).

### Repetition
1. Due to the capabilities of the Ugarit alignment software, the first instance of a word that is repeated in one language (typically in ENG) is aligned to the single instance in the other language.
2. Repetition is typically a dramatic flair in translation and therefore irrelevant to the alignment.

### Negation
Align negation 1-1, (i.e., uses of οὐ, μή) unless:
  1. The negative English morpheme is abbreviated (-n't) and cannot be separated from the word group.
  2. The structure of a verbal phrase is changed in English.

### Verbs
Because of the complex nature of Greek verbs, verbal groups are aligned as a single unit. These can be N-N, N-1, 1-N.
1. Notes on verbs and subjects:
   - If the subject is a separate noun or pronoun, it is aligned 1-1.
   - When the subject is implicit in *both* languages, only the verb is aligned.
   - When the subject is explicit in English, but implicit in Greek:
     - A pronoun is aligned together with the verb (1-N).
     - If the English subject is a noun or proper noun it is left unaligned.
   - Everything listed above applies to the accusative + infinitive construction.
2. If the translator alters the voice of a verb but it retains the same meaning, the verb is aligned regardless of voice.
3. Compound verbs in Greek are aligned with the full English expression. Example: ἀναβάλλω – “I throw up”
4. If they are necessary to fully understand the meaning of the verb, extra prepositions in the English text are aligned in the verb group.

### Participles
1. Participles with attributive/implicit forms align with the corresponding word/s. The agreeing noun is aligned separately.
2. Participles acting as dependent clauses in English are aligned 1-N.
3. Substantive and attributive participles are aligned with the full explicit translation. Example: τούς μέν ἔχοντας - some people who had: ‘τούς μέν’ - ‘some people’; ‘ἔχοντας᾽ - ‘who had’ (Palladino and  Shamsian). 
4. When there is an article that corresponds with the participle, it is aligned N-N. 
5. Genitive absolutes follow the standard practices for participles, with the agreeing noun aligned separately.

### Prepositional Phrases
 Prepositional phrases are aligned with each component 1-1 when possible. If the equivalent English expression is imperfect, the annotator's discretion is to be employed.
 
### Cases Uses
1. Inflected nouns are aligned with the corresponding English translation 1-N. Example: ‘χριστοῦ’ – “of Christ”.
2. Modifiers do not obey the above rule.
3. If English prepositions do not correctly convey Greek meaning, the Greek word is *only* aligned with the lexical translation.

### Pronouns
1. Pronouns that correspond in English are aligned 1-1.
2. Pronouns that replace a noun in one language are not aligned.

### Determiners (articles, etc.)
1. When determiners are found to be equivalent in Greek and English, they are aligned 1-1.
2. When they are not equivalent in meaning, only the nouns which they correspond to are aligned.
3. When the determiner is found *only* in English *but* the nouns are semantically equivalent, the Greek-English alignment should be 1-N.
4. Phrasal translations are aligned to the determiner + noun group N-1 or N-N.

### Adjectives and Adverbs
1. These are aligned as individual lexical units.
2. Comparatives and superlatives are aligned with the full corresponding English translation, which can result in 1-1 or 1-N links.
